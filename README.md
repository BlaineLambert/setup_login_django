## Mastery Check (Project)

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

With this module, you now have the ability to build a web application where users can create, read, update, and delete data that they own.
A user can have their own tweets, todos, journal entries, friends, playlists, etc.

For this module, your mastery check is to build a project that exercises this ability.

Here are the baseline requirements. Your application must:

- Allow Users to:
  - [ ] sign-up
  - [ ] login
  - [ ] logout
  - [ ] create new data in the system that is associated with the user
  - [ ] update data in the system that is associated with the user
  - [ ] read data from the system that is associated with the user
  - [ ] delete data in the system that is associated with the user
- [ ] Use Form objects to validate user data
- [ ] Use appropriate database relationship fields to model relationships between data
- [ ] Restrict some pages to logged in users
- [ ] Utilize Permissions (and possibly Groups) to control user authorization. For example:
  - You app could have an admin or moderator user group that has more permissions than a standard user.
  - You app could involve two different kinds of users that use the website in complementary ways. For example:
    - Github Classroom: Teachers create assignments that they give to students
    - LinkedIn: Companies create jobs that candidates apply to
    - Uber: Riders request rides, and a Driver provides rides
